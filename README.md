## Voicenotes Sync
Plugin offers the ability to sync down your thoughts an ideas from the voicenotes.com online service. The service
uses an API key which the plugin can grab post login and we do not save anything but the username in the settings file.

Through the plugin settings one can customize the sync directory and frequency, download the audio file used in the 
transcript and any AI generated summaries or actions become sections in the note text.

### Features
- Sync data from VoiceNotes.com including any AI generated summaries or actions
- Customize the sync directory and frequency
- Downloads the audio file (default is off)
- Optional mode to delete synced notes from the voicenotes.com server
  - Destructive action which requires double opt-in toggles
